The main optimization target is the size of the quantum computer, i.e., the number of logical qubits required, as this appears to be the main obstacle to implementing Shor's polynomial-time discrete-logarithm algorithm. The secondary optimization target is the number of logical Toffoli gates. For an elliptic curve over a field of 2ˆn elements, this paper reduces the number of qubits to 7n+[log_2(n)]+9. At the same time this paper reduces the number of Toffoli gates to 48nˆ3+8nˆ(log_2(3)+1)+352nˆ2 log_2(n)+512nˆ2+O(nˆ(log_2(3))) with double-and-add scalar multiplication, and a logarithmic factor smaller with fixed-window scalar multiplication.

  {"id":"banegasQuantumResistantSecuritySoftware2021","abstract":"As the Internet of Things (IoT) rolls out today to devices whose lifetime may well exceed a decade, conservative threat models should consider attackers with access to quantum computing power. The SUIT standard (specified by the IETF) defines a security architecture for IoT software updates, standardizing the metadata and the cryptographic tools-namely, digital signatures and hash functions-that guarantee the legitimacy of software updates. While the performance of SUIT has previously been evaluated in the pre-quantum context, it has not yet been studied in a post-quantum context. Taking the open-source implementation of SUIT available in RIOT as a case study, we overview post-quantum considerations, and quantum-resistant digital signatures in particular, focusing on lowpower, microcontroller-based IoT devices which have stringent resource constraints in terms of memory, CPU, and energy consumption. We benchmark a selection of proposed post-quantum signature schemes (LMS, Falcon, and Dilithium) and compare them with current pre-quantum signature schemes (Ed25519 and ECDSA). Our benchmarks are carried out on a variety of IoT hardware including ARM Cortex-M, RISC-V, and Espressif (ESP32), which form the bulk of modern 32-bit microcontroller architectures. We interpret our benchmark results in the context of SUIT, and estimate the real-world impact of post-quantum alternatives for a range of typical software update categories.

  {"id":"bennettStrengthsWeaknessesQuantum1997","abstract":"In this paper we study quantum computation from a complexity theoretic viewpoint. Our first result is the existence of an efficient universal quantum Turing machine in Deutsch's model of a quantum Turing machine (QTM) [Proc. Roy. Soc. London Ser. A, 400 (1985), pp. 97–117]. This construction is substantially more complicated than the corresponding construction for classical Turing machines (TMs); in fact, even simple primitives such as looping, branching, and composition are not straightforward in the context of quantum Turing machines. We establish how these familiar primitives can be implemented and introduce some new, purely quantum mechanical primitives, such as changing the computational basis and carrying out an arbitrary unitary transformation of polynomially bounded dimension.We also consider the precision to which the transition amplitudes of a quantum Turing machine need to be specified. We prove that \\O(\\textbackslashlog T)\\ bits of precision suffice to support a T step computation. This justifies the claim that the quantum Turing machine model should be regarded as a discrete model of computation and not an analog one. We give the first formal evidence that quantum Turing machines violate the modern (complexity theoretic) formulation of the Church–Turing thesis. We show the existence of a problem, relative to an oracle, that can be solved in polynomial time on a quantum Turing machine, but requires superpolynomial time on a bounded-error probabilistic Turing machine, and thus not in the class {\\textbackslashBPP\\. The class {\\textbackslashBQP\\ of languages that are efficiently decidable (with small error-probability) on a quantum Turing machine satisfies {\\textbackslashBPP \\textbackslashsubseteq \\textbackslashBQP \\textbackslashsubseteq \\textbackslashPtimeˆ{\\textbackslashSP}\\.

  {"id":"ebrahimiPostQuantumCryptoprocessorsOptimized2019","abstract":"By exponential increase in applications of the Internet of Things (IoT), such as smart ecosystems or e-health, more security threats have been introduced. In order to resist known attacks for IoT networks, multiple security protocols must be established among nodes. Thus, IoT devices are required to execute various cryptographic operations, such as public key encryption/decryption. However, classic public key cryptosystems, such as Rivest-Shammir-Adlemon and elliptic curve cryptography are computationally more complex to be efficiently implemented on IoT devices and are vulnerable regarding quantum attacks. Therefore, after complete development of quantum computing, these cryptosystems will not be secure and practical. In this paper, we propose InvRBLWE, an optimized variant for binary learning with errors over the ring (Ring-LWE) scheme that is proven to be secure against quantum attacks and is highly efficient for hardware implementations. We propose two architectures for InvRBLWE: 1) a high-speed architecture targeting edge and powerful IoT devices and 2) an ultralightweight architecture, which can be implemented on resource-constrained nodes in IoT. The proposed architectures are scalable regarding security levels and we provide experimental results for two versions of the InvRBLWE scheme providing 84 and 190 bits of classic security. Our implementation results on field programmable gate array dominate the best of the classic and post-quantum previous implementations. Moreover, our two different application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) implementations show improvement in terms of speed, area, power, and/or energy.

We analyzed the challenges in the process as well as the performance, correctness and security of the implemented algorithms. The performance of the integrated algorithms was overall good, but the integration process had its challenges, many of which were caused by the mathematical complexity of lattice-based algorithms.

  {"id":"schoffelEnergyCostsPostQuantum2021","abstract":"Recent achievements in designing quantum computers place a serious threat on the security of state-of-the-art public key cryptography and on all communication that relies on it. Meanwhile, security is seen as one of the most critical issues of low-power IoT devices even with pre-quantum public key cryptography since IoT devices have strict energy constraints and limited computational power. Thus, state-of-the-art dedicated hardware accelerators have been deployed to facilitate secure and confidential communication with well established protocols on such devices. It is common belief that the complexity of the cryptographic computations are also the bottleneck of the new, quantum-resistant algorithms and that hardware accelerators are necessary to use them efficiently on energy constrained embedded devices. In this paper, we carried out an in-depth investigation of the application of potential Post-Quantum Cryptography algorithms, which were proposed in the associated US NIST process, to a representative TLS-based low-power IoT infrastructure. First, we show that the main contributor to the TLS handshake latency are the higher bandwidth requirements of post-quantum Key-Encapsulation Mechanisms rather than the cryptographic computations itself. Second, from the perspective of crypto-agility we show that edge devices with code-based, isogeny-based as well as lattice-based algorithms have low energy consumption, which enables long battery run times in typical IoT scenarios without dedicated hardware accelerators. Third, we increase the level of security further by combining pre-quantum and post-quantum algorithms to a hybrid key exchange, and quantify the overhead in energy consumption and latency of it.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Schöffel","given":"Maximilian"},{"family":"Lauer","given":"Frederik"},{"family":"Rheinländer","given":"Carl C."},{"family":"Wehn","given":"Norbert"}],"citation-key":"schoffelEnergyCostsPostQuantum2021","collection-title":"IoTDI '21","container-title":"Proceedings of the International Conference on Internet-of-Things Design and Implementation","DOI":"10.1145/3450268.3453528","event-place":"New York, NY, USA","ISBN":"978-1-4503-8354-7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",5]]},"page":"158–168","publisher":"Association for Computing Machinery","publisher-place":"New York, NY, USA","title":"On the Energy Costs of Post-Quantum KEMs in TLS-based Low-Power Secure IoT","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3450268.3453528"},

Our first result is the existence of an efficient universal quantum Turing machine in Deutsch's model of a quantum Turing machine (QTM) [Proc. Roy. Soc. London Ser. A, 400 (1985), pp. 97–117]. This construction is substantially more complicated than the corresponding construction for classical Turing machines (TMs); in fact, even simple primitives such as looping, branching, and composition are not straightforward in the context of quantum Turing machines. We establish how these familiar primitives can be implemented and introduce some new, purely quantum mechanical primitives, such as changing the computational basis and carrying out an arbitrary unitary transformation of polynomially bounded dimension.We also consider the precision to which the transition amplitudes of a quantum Turing machine need to be specified. We prove that \\O(\\textbackslashlog T)\\ bits of precision suffice to support a T step computation. This justifies the claim that the quantum Turing machine model should be regarded as a discrete model of computation and not an analog one. We give the first formal evidence that quantum Turing machines violate the modern (complexity theoretic) formulation of the Church–Turing thesis. We show the existence of a problem, relative to an oracle, that can be solved in polynomial time on a quantum Turing machine, but requires superpolynomial time on a bounded-error probabilistic Turing machine, and thus not in the class {\\textbackslashBPP\\.

This questions the security of deep neural networks (DNN) for many security- and trust-sensitive domains. The majority of the proposed existing adversarial attacks are based on the differentiability of the DNN cost function.Defence strategies are mostly based on machine learning and signal processing principles that either try to detect-reject or filter out the adversarial perturbations and completely neglect the classical cryptographic component in the defence. In this work, we propose a new defence mechanism based on the second Kerckhoffs's cryptographic principle which states that the defence and classification algorithm are supposed to be known, but not the key. To be compliant with the assumption that the attacker does not have access to the secret key, we will primarily focus on a gray-box scenario and do not address a white-box one. More particularly, we assume that the attacker does not have direct access to the secret block, but (a) he completely knows the system architecture, (b) he has access to the data used for training and testing and (c) he can observe the output of the classifier for each given input. We show empirically that our system is efficient against most famous state-of-the-art attacks in black-box and gray-box scenarios.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Taran","given":"Olga"},{"family":"Rezaeifar","given":"Shideh"},{"family":"Voloshynovskiy","given":"Slava"}],"citation-key":"taranBridgingMachineLearning2018","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.1809.01715","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",9]]},"publisher":"arXiv","title":"Bridging machine learning and cryptography in defence against adversarial attacks","type":"document","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.01715"},

  {"id":"tiwariNovelMethodDNABased2018","abstract":"Elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) can achieve relatively good security with a smaller key length, making it suitable for Internet of Things (IoT) devices. DNA-based encryption has also been proven to have good security. To develop a more secure and stable cryptography technique, we propose a new hybrid DNA-encoded ECC scheme that provides multilevel security. The DNA sequence is selected, and using a sorting algorithm, a unique set of nucleotide groups is assigned. These are directly converted to binary sequence and then encrypted using the ECC; thus giving double-fold security. Using several examples, this paper shows how this complete method can be realized on IoT devices. To verify the performance, we implement the complete system on the embedded platform of a Raspberry Pi 3 board, and utilize an active sensor data input to calculate the time and energy required for different data vector sizes. Connectivity and resilience analysis prove that DNA-mapped ECC can provide better security compared to ECC alone. The proposed method shows good potential for upcoming IoT technologies that require a smaller but effective security system.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Tiwari","given":"Harsh Durga"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Jae Hyung"}],"citation-key":"tiwariNovelMethodDNABased2018","container-title":"ETRI Journal","DOI":"10.4218/etrij.2017-0220","ISSN":"2233-7326","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2018 ETRI","page":"396–409","title":"Novel Method for DNA-Based Elliptic Curve Cryptography for IoT Devices","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.4218/etrij.2017-0220","volume":"40"},

  {"id":"yiMachineLearningMethod2023","abstract":"Machine learning (ML) is the core of Artificial Intelligence (AI), and it is the fundamental way to make computer have intelligence. ML is a technology that uses algorithms to parse data, constantly learn, and make judgements and predictions about what happens. With the continuous development of ML technology, using ML algorithms to analyze the security of physical hardware has gradually become one of the hot spots in the research field. In the field of hardware security, post quantum cryptography is one of the research hotspots, e.g., multivariate cryptography. However, analyzing post-quantum signatures based on ML is still in the early stage. As substitutions of current used signatures, post-quantum signatures should fully consider side channel attack based on ML techniques so that they can be used in reality. In order to address such challenges, we present ML techniques to exploit the measurement of side channel attacks to post-quantum signatures. We propose a ML model for the measurement of side channel attacks. The efficiency of the proposed model is measured and it can be extended to analyze other similar signatures.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Yi","given":"Haibo"}],"citation-key":"yiMachineLearningMethod2023","container-title":"J Grid Computing","DOI":"10.1007/s10723-023-09643-4","ISSN":"1572-9184","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",3]]},"language":"en","page":"19","title":"Machine Learning Method with Applications in Hardware Security of Post-Quantum Cryptography","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10723-023-09643-4","volume":"21"},
