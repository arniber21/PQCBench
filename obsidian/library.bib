  abstract = {Machine learning techniques have had a long list of applications in recent years. However, the use of machine learning in information and network security is not new. Machine learning and cryptography have many things in common. The most apparent is the processing of large amounts of data and large search spaces. In its varying techniques, machine learning has been an interesting field of study with massive potential for application. In the past three decades, machine learning techniques, whether supervised or unsupervised, have been applied in cryptographic algorithms, cryptanalysis, steganography, among other data-security-related applications. This paper presents an updated survey of applications of machine learning techniques in cryptography and cryptanalysis. The paper summarizes the research done in these areas and provides suggestions for future directions in research.},

The main optimization target is the size of the quantum computer, i.e., the number of logical qubits required, as this appears to be the main obstacle to implementing Shor's polynomial-time discrete-logarithm algorithm. The secondary optimization target is the number of logical Toffoli gates. For an elliptic curve over a field of 2ˆn elements, this paper reduces the number of qubits to 7n+[log\_2(n)]+9. At the same time this paper reduces the number of Toffoli gates to 48nˆ3+8nˆ(log\_2(3)+1)+352nˆ2 log\_2(n)+512nˆ2+O(nˆ(log\_2(3))) with double-and-add scalar multiplication, and a logarithmic factor smaller with fixed-window scalar multiplication. The number of CNOT gates is also O(nˆ3). Exact gate counts are given for various sizes of elliptic curves currently used for cryptography.},

  abstract = {As the Internet of Things (IoT) rolls out today to devices whose lifetime may well exceed a decade, conservative threat models should consider attackers with access to quantum computing power. The SUIT standard (specified by the IETF) defines a security architecture for IoT software updates, standardizing the metadata and the cryptographic tools-namely, digital signatures and hash functions-that guarantee the legitimacy of software updates. While the performance of SUIT has previously been evaluated in the pre-quantum context, it has not yet been studied in a post-quantum context. Taking the open-source implementation of SUIT available in RIOT as a case study, we overview post-quantum considerations, and quantum-resistant digital signatures in particular, focusing on lowpower, microcontroller-based IoT devices which have stringent resource constraints in terms of memory, CPU, and energy consumption. We benchmark a selection of proposed post-quantum signature schemes (LMS, Falcon, and Dilithium) and compare them with current pre-quantum signature schemes (Ed25519 and ECDSA). Our benchmarks are carried out on a variety of IoT hardware including ARM Cortex-M, RISC-V, and Espressif (ESP32), which form the bulk of modern 32-bit microcontroller architectures. We interpret our benchmark results in the context of SUIT, and estimate the real-world impact of post-quantum alternatives for a range of typical software update categories.

  abstract = {In this paper we study quantum computation from a complexity theoretic viewpoint. Our first result is the existence of an efficient universal quantum Turing machine in Deutsch's model of a quantum Turing machine (QTM) [Proc. Roy. Soc. London Ser. A, 400 (1985), pp. 97–117]. This construction is substantially more complicated than the corresponding construction for classical Turing machines (TMs); in fact, even simple primitives such as looping, branching, and composition are not straightforward in the context of quantum Turing machines. We establish how these familiar primitives can be implemented and introduce some new, purely quantum mechanical primitives, such as changing the computational basis and carrying out an arbitrary unitary transformation of polynomially bounded dimension.We also consider the precision to which the transition amplitudes of a quantum Turing machine need to be specified. We prove that \textbackslash O(\textbackslash textbackslashlog T)\textbackslash{} bits of precision suffice to support a T step computation. This justifies the claim that the quantum Turing machine model should be regarded as a discrete model of computation and not an analog one. We give the first formal evidence that quantum Turing machines violate the modern (complexity theoretic) formulation of the Church–Turing thesis. We show the existence of a problem, relative to an oracle, that can be solved in polynomial time on a quantum Turing machine, but requires superpolynomial time on a bounded-error probabilistic Turing machine, and thus not in the class \{\textbackslash textbackslashBPP\textbackslash. The class \{\textbackslash textbackslashBQP\textbackslash{} of languages that are efficiently decidable (with small error-probability) on a quantum Turing machine satisfies \{\textbackslash textbackslashBPP \textbackslash textbackslashsubseteq \textbackslash textbackslashBQP \textbackslash textbackslashsubseteq \textbackslash textbackslashPtimeˆ\{\textbackslash textbackslashSP\}\textbackslash. Therefore, there is no possibility of giving a mathematical proof that quantum Turing machines are more powerful than classical probabilistic Turing machines (in the unrelativized setting) unless there is a major breakthrough in complexity theory.\vphantom{\}\}\}}}

With this increasing global network, electronic communication between devices is becoming wireless and ubiquitous. Also, most of the IoT services will be realized as real time embedded systems which rely heavily on security mechanisms. This makes security imperative to embedded devices in IoT. This paper presents security challenges faced by system designers while designing secure embedded systems. The most difficult task for embedded system security is implementation of Public Key Cryptography (PKC). PKC based on Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) which uses smaller key sizes is efficient for both private and public operations. Moreover, with IoT several embedded devices are becoming interconnected which makes ECC advantageous when you need to embed security. The comparative study suggests that ECC is best suited for resource constrained real time embedded systems in IoT.},

  abstract = {By exponential increase in applications of the Internet of Things (IoT), such as smart ecosystems or e-health, more security threats have been introduced. In order to resist known attacks for IoT networks, multiple security protocols must be established among nodes. Thus, IoT devices are required to execute various cryptographic operations, such as public key encryption/decryption. However, classic public key cryptosystems, such as Rivest-Shammir-Adlemon and elliptic curve cryptography are computationally more complex to be efficiently implemented on IoT devices and are vulnerable regarding quantum attacks. Therefore, after complete development of quantum computing, these cryptosystems will not be secure and practical. In this paper, we propose InvRBLWE, an optimized variant for binary learning with errors over the ring (Ring-LWE) scheme that is proven to be secure against quantum attacks and is highly efficient for hardware implementations. We propose two architectures for InvRBLWE: 1) a high-speed architecture targeting edge and powerful IoT devices and 2) an ultralightweight architecture, which can be implemented on resource-constrained nodes in IoT. The proposed architectures are scalable regarding security levels and we provide experimental results for two versions of the InvRBLWE scheme providing 84 and 190 bits of classic security. Our implementation results on field programmable gate array dominate the best of the classic and post-quantum previous implementations. Moreover, our two different application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) implementations show improvement in terms of speed, area, power, and/or energy. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to implement learning with error-based cryptosystems on ASIC platform.},

Post-quantum algorithms have been designed for the purpose of protecting sensitive data against attacks with quantum computers.

Three of the chosen algorithms are based on lattices. When implementing complex cryptographic algorithms, developers commonly use cryptographic libraries in their solutions to avoid mistakes. However, most of the open-source cryptography libraries do not yet have post-quantum algorithms integrated in them. We chose a C++ cryptography library, Crypto++, and created a fork where we integrated four lattice-based post-quantum algorithms. We analyzed the challenges in the process as well as the performance, correctness and security of the implemented algorithms. The performance of the integrated algorithms was overall good, but the integration process had its challenges, many of which were caused by the mathematical complexity of lattice-based algorithms. Different open-source implementations of post-quantum algorithms will be essential to their easier use for developers. Usability of the implementations is also important to avoid possible mistakes when using the algorithms.},

This paper surveys the practicality of deployment of these schemes.

Nowadays, the possibility of collecting a large amount of observations paves the way to the adoption of machine learning techniques, i.e., techniques able to extract information and patterns from large datasets. The use of statistical techniques for side-channel attacks is not new. Techniques like the template attack have shown their effectiveness in recent years.

Nothing Upon My Sleeves (NUMS) curves are among the potential candidates presented in the workshop. Here, we present the first implementation of the NUMS256, NUMS379, and NUMS384 curves on two types of embedded devices. The implementations, which exhibit regular, constant-time execution to protect against timing and simple side-channel attacks, set new speed records and advance the state-of-the-art of curve-based (without endomorphism) scalar multiplication on 8-bit AVR and 32-bit ARM11 microcontrollers. For example, our NUMS256 implementation computes a scalar multiplication in 1.4 million cycles on a low-power 32-bit ARM11 microcontroller using mixed C and assembly language. These results demonstrate the potential of deploying IoT-NUMS on constrained and low-power applications such as protocols for the Internet of Things.},

Quantum computers threaten public key cryptography algorithms like RSA (Rivest, Shamir, Adleman) and Diffie-Hellman (DH) key exchange schemes, which are widely in use today.

A prominent example is secure communication, i.e., the task of transmitting confidential messages from one location to another. The cryptographic requirement here is that the transmitted messages remain inaccessible to anyone other than the designated recipients, even if the communication channel is untrustworthy. In classical cryptography, this can usually be guaranteed only under computational hardness assumptions, such as when factoring large integers is infeasible. In contrast, the security of quantum cryptography relies entirely on the laws of quantum mechanics. Here this physical notion of security is reviewed, with a focus on quantum key distribution and secure communication.}

Our approach allows gate-level comparisons to recent resource estimates for Shor’s factoring algorithm. The results also support estimates given earlier by Proos and Zalka and indicate that, for current parameters at comparable classical security levels, the number of qubits required to tackle elliptic curves is less than for attacking RSA, suggesting that indeed ECC is an easier target than RSA.},

  abstract = {Recent achievements in designing quantum computers place a serious threat on the security of state-of-the-art public key cryptography and on all communication that relies on it. Meanwhile, security is seen as one of the most critical issues of low-power IoT devices even with pre-quantum public key cryptography since IoT devices have strict energy constraints and limited computational power. Thus, state-of-the-art dedicated hardware accelerators have been deployed to facilitate secure and confidential communication with well established protocols on such devices. It is common belief that the complexity of the cryptographic computations are also the bottleneck of the new, quantum-resistant algorithms and that hardware accelerators are necessary to use them efficiently on energy constrained embedded devices. In this paper, we carried out an in-depth investigation of the application of potential Post-Quantum Cryptography algorithms, which were proposed in the associated US NIST process, to a representative TLS-based low-power IoT infrastructure. First, we show that the main contributor to the TLS handshake latency are the higher bandwidth requirements of post-quantum Key-Encapsulation Mechanisms rather than the cryptographic computations itself. Second, from the perspective of crypto-agility we show that edge devices with code-based, isogeny-based as well as lattice-based algorithms have low energy consumption, which enables long battery run times in typical IoT scenarios without dedicated hardware accelerators. Third, we increase the level of security further by combining pre-quantum and post-quantum algorithms to a hybrid key exchange, and quantify the overhead in energy consumption and latency of it.},

Communication of things makes it important to ensure security in this interactive architecture. One of the developments that are subject to change in IoT environments is post-quantum cryptography. This evolution, which includes the change of asymmetric cryptosystems, affects the security of IoT devices. In this paper, fundamental characteristics and layered architecture of IoT environments are examined. Basic security requirements and solution technologies for IoT architecture are remembered. Some important open problems in the literature for IoT device security are recalled. From these open problems, the post-quantum security of IoT devices with limited resources is focused. The main purpose of this paper is to improve the constrained resource classification and give a point of view for post-quantum IoT security. In this context, a sensitive classification is proposed by improving the limited resource classification of IETF. The cryptosystem efficiency definition is made for the analysis of resource-constrained device security. Using the proposed classification and efficiency definition, the usage of lattice-based cryptosystems in resource-constrained IoT device security is analyzed.},

Our first result is the existence of an efficient universal quantum Turing machine in Deutsch's model of a quantum Turing machine (QTM) [Proc. Roy. Soc. London Ser. A, 400 (1985), pp. 97–117]. This construction is substantially more complicated than the corresponding construction for classical Turing machines (TMs); in fact, even simple primitives such as looping, branching, and composition are not straightforward in the context of quantum Turing machines. We establish how these familiar primitives can be implemented and introduce some new, purely quantum mechanical primitives, such as changing the computational basis and carrying out an arbitrary unitary transformation of polynomially bounded dimension.We also consider the precision to which the transition amplitudes of a quantum Turing machine need to be specified. We prove that \textbackslash O(\textbackslash textbackslashlog T)\textbackslash{} bits of precision suffice to support a T step computation. This justifies the claim that the quantum Turing machine model should be regarded as a discrete model of computation and not an analog one. We give the first formal evidence that quantum Turing machines violate the modern (complexity theoretic) formulation of the Church–Turing thesis. We show the existence of a problem, relative to an oracle, that can be solved in polynomial time on a quantum Turing machine, but requires superpolynomial time on a bounded-error probabilistic Turing machine, and thus not in the class \{\textbackslash textbackslashBPP\textbackslash. The class \{\textbackslash textbackslashBQP\textbackslash{} of languages that are efficiently decidable (with small error-probability) on a quantum Turing machine satisfies \{\textbackslash textbackslashBPP \textbackslash textbackslashsubseteq \textbackslash textbackslashBQP \textbackslash textbackslashsubseteq \textbackslash textbackslashPtimeˆ\{\textbackslash textbackslashSP\}\textbackslash.

  abstract = {Adversarially robust neural cryptography deals with the training of a neural-based model using an adversary to leverage the learning process in favor of reliability and trustworthiness. The adversary can be a neural network or a strategy guided by a neural network. These mechanisms are proving successful in finding secure means of data protection. Similarly, machine learning benefits significantly from the cryptography area by protecting models from being accessible to malicious users. This paper is a literature review on the symbiotic relationship between machine learning and cryptography. We explain cryptographic algorithms that have been successfully applied in machine learning problems and, also, deep learning algorithms that have been used in cryptography. We pay special attention to the exciting and relatively new area of adversarial robustness.},

  abstract = {This standard specifies the stateless hash-based digital signature algorithm (SLH-DSA). Digital signatures are used to detect unauthorized modifications to data and to authenticate the identity of the signatory. In addition, the recipient of signed data can use a digital signature as evidence in demonstrating to a third party that the signature was, in fact, generated by the claimed signatory. This is known as non-repudiation since the signatory cannot easily repudiate the signature at a later time. SLH-DSA is based on SPHINCS+, which was selected for standardization as part of the NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization process.},

  abstract = {In the last decade, deep learning algorithms have become very popular thanks to the achieved performance in many machine learning and computer vision tasks. However, most of the deep learning architectures are vulnerable to so called adversarial examples. This questions the security of deep neural networks (DNN) for many security- and trust-sensitive domains. The majority of the proposed existing adversarial attacks are based on the differentiability of the DNN cost function.Defence strategies are mostly based on machine learning and signal processing principles that either try to detect-reject or filter out the adversarial perturbations and completely neglect the classical cryptographic component in the defence. In this work, we propose a new defence mechanism based on the second Kerckhoffs's cryptographic principle which states that the defence and classification algorithm are supposed to be known, but not the key. To be compliant with the assumption that the attacker does not have access to the secret key, we will primarily focus on a gray-box scenario and do not address a white-box one. More particularly, we assume that the attacker does not have direct access to the secret block, but (a) he completely knows the system architecture, (b) he has access to the data used for training and testing and (c) he can observe the output of the classifier for each given input. We show empirically that our system is efficient against most famous state-of-the-art attacks in black-box and gray-box scenarios.},

  abstract = {Elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) can achieve relatively good security with a smaller key length, making it suitable for Internet of Things (IoT) devices. DNA-based encryption has also been proven to have good security. To develop a more secure and stable cryptography technique, we propose a new hybrid DNA-encoded ECC scheme that provides multilevel security. The DNA sequence is selected, and using a sorting algorithm, a unique set of nucleotide groups is assigned. These are directly converted to binary sequence and then encrypted using the ECC; thus giving double-fold security. Using several examples, this paper shows how this complete method can be realized on IoT devices. To verify the performance, we implement the complete system on the embedded platform of a Raspberry Pi 3 board, and utilize an active sensor data input to calculate the time and energy required for different data vector sizes. Connectivity and resilience analysis prove that DNA-mapped ECC can provide better security compared to ECC alone. The proposed method shows good potential for upcoming IoT technologies that require a smaller but effective security system.},

  abstract = {Machine learning (ML) is the core of Artificial Intelligence (AI), and it is the fundamental way to make computer have intelligence. ML is a technology that uses algorithms to parse data, constantly learn, and make judgements and predictions about what happens. With the continuous development of ML technology, using ML algorithms to analyze the security of physical hardware has gradually become one of the hot spots in the research field. In the field of hardware security, post quantum cryptography is one of the research hotspots, e.g., multivariate cryptography. However, analyzing post-quantum signatures based on ML is still in the early stage. As substitutions of current used signatures, post-quantum signatures should fully consider side channel attack based on ML techniques so that they can be used in reality. In order to address such challenges, we present ML techniques to exploit the measurement of side channel attacks to post-quantum signatures. We propose a ML model for the measurement of side channel attacks. The efficiency of the proposed model is measured and it can be extended to analyze other similar signatures.},

Quantum Computing (QC) is a new paradigm that imposes itself as a main technology in the near future, especially in the 6G era, due to its powerful computations. As a result, immigration of the IoT and BC to the QC has to be studied and prepared. This paper provides a brief review of relevant recent work to identify opportunities for optimal integration. Besides, a new paradigm called Quantum Chain of Things (QCoT) is proposed and its perspective architecture is presented and verified into two parts: (a) BC-IoT using Arduino, and (b) QC-IoT using IBM Qiskit simulator. Finally, presented knowledge such as current challenges, threads, and integration opportunities could help researchers to investigate new trends and future directions.},
