# Store Now, Decrypt Later
Although quantum computers are quite a far ways out from reliably breaking cryptography at a scale to pose a threat, attackers are not necessarily deterred. Rather, they opt for a strategy of *Store Now, Decrypt Later*. As the name suggests, malicious third parties will obtain large amounts of raw, encrypted, potentially valuable information; they then essentially hoard this information, with the promise of easily decrypting information in the future. Therefore, even if quantum computers do not pose a threat in the present, it is vital that robust PQC is implemented currently in order to prevent the effectiveness of SNDL attacks.
