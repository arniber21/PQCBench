# Quantum Computing
## Classical Computing
The power and difficulties of quantum computing are best illustrated in comparison to the strengths and weaknesses of classical computation. 

There are many ways to define a computer in mathematical terms. Let us note, however, two crucial facets of computation irrespective of definition: 
1. Computers *store* data in some manner
2. Computers *process* data in some manner
Classical and Quantum computers fundamentally differ in their approaches to these two steps. For classical computers, data storage occurs in the form of *binary*: data, irrespective of format, is converted into a binary string of digits (0s or 1s) which are stored, often digitally, through transistors. Utilizing encoding schemes, we may encode nearly all types of usable data into a binary format: integers, decimals, Booleans (true or false values), strings (sequences of characters), etc. 

Utilizing a binary numerical system to store data gives classical computing models many properties which are often appraised to all computers in a more general sense (which is intuitive given nearly all computers utilize a classical computing model). Classical computers store data exactly and precisely. Their binary nature is conducive to the on-off state of electrical circuits, which allowed for the digitalization of storage. Though large and expensive at first, the discovery of the microprocessor and the proliferation of smaller and smaller transistors have allowed for data storage capabilities to rise significantly. Their precision is conducive to exact, numerical calculations with far greater reliability and speed than their human counterparts (even if it may seem inefficient to deal purely with 0s and 1s).
