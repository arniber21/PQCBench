#### NIST-Selected Algorithms
In early 2018, NIST held a competition in order to enshrine an algorithm to be the federal standard for post-quantum cryptography. The competition results, announced in 2022, produced four algorithms, three of which use LWE [@NISTAnnouncesFirst2022]. Later in 2023, NIST announced four Federal Information Processing Standards for post-quantum cryptographic communication: FIPS 203, FIPS 204, and FIPS 205 [@ThreeDraftFIPS2023]. These standards indicate a federal willingness and recognition of the massive threat that Shor's Algorithm (and now Regev's Algorithm) represent to modern cryptography and communication.
