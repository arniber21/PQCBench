# ECC
Recently, an alternative to RSA cryptosystems has arisen: Elliptic-Curve Cryptography, or ECC for short. ECC relies on a different mathematical construction: namely, the discrete logarithm problem [@schneierAppliedCryptographyProtocols1996]. Define the discrete logarithm problem as follows: given a group $G$ and generator $g \in G$ and element $h \in G$, we can say that $\log_g(h) = x$, if $x$ exists such that $x$ is an integer and $g^x = h$. To take advantage of the discrete logarithm problem, elliptic curve cryptography defines elliptic curves over finite fields. In doing so, they are able to use much smaller key sizes than other algorithms while maintaining similar or even improved levels of security, especially in security-critical IoT infrastructure often afforded significant performance hindrances [@dhillonEllipticCurveCryptography2016]. 

Elliptic Curve Cryptography is largely considered preferential to RSA and Diffie-Hellman based approaches to security. NIST has standardized the set of elliptic curves in Federal Information Processing Standard(s) (FIPS) 186, currently in its 5th iteration (note that the fourth generation of elliptic curve standards set by FIPS 186-4 is set to be retired in the early weeks of February 2024) [@DigitalSignatureStandard2023].
