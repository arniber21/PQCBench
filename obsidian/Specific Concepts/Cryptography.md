# Cryptography
Cryptography is the discipline concerning the protection of information. Primarily, cryptography is used to secure communication between two parties or to secure stored data. Cryptographers work to either *encrypt* information (obfuscate the message delivered from all non-intended parties), *decrypt* information (de-obfuscate the information for the intended party), or communicate the obfuscated message from one party to another in a secure manner. In general, we define a cryptographic algorithm as an algorithm that achieves one or more of the specified functions. We define a cryptographic scheme as a set of cryptographic algorithms or a general approach for satisfying all of these requirements. 

When a cryptographic algorithm encrypts information, we call the message we wish to encrypt the *plaintext*. The algorithm successfully encrypts this plaintext into a *ciphertext*, which is obfuscated from all non-intended parties. The intended party, then, decrypts the ciphertext back to its plaintext form using a decryption algorithm.  

The vast majority of cryptographic schemes utilize a special set of mathematical problems we define as *intractable*. These intractable problems are mathematical problems that are infeasible to solve without some information, which we may call a key. The key is generated as some part of the cryptographic scheme, then used by both parties to encrypt or decrypt the desired message.
