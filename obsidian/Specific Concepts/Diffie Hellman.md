# Diffie Hellman
One may consider that previously, we presumed most cryptosystems to be using a singular key in order to crack the ciphertext. There is a problem with this single-key approach, however: we must convey the key somehow to the intended party without the prying eyes of unintended parties. In the past, this was achieved through physical means beforehand; however, in the modern era, most cryptosystems implement the Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm (or something very similar) to achieve this. 

The details of the Diffie-Hellman algorithm are not necessary to understand this paper; simply recall that Diffie-Hellman results in the distribution of *two* keys: a public key and a private key. The public key is freely distributed, and the private key is solely in the hands of the two verified parties. The first algorithm of a KEM cryptosystem generates these two keys.
