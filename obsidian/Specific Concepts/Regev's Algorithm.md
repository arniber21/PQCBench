# Regev's Algorithm 
Shor's Algorithm, while presenting a considerable threat to modern cryptography, is made less formidable by its theoretical nature and still slow promises. While certainly an improvement of multiple magnitudes from previous estimates, Shor's Algorithm remains infeasible to implement without a large quantum computer. This gives us a level of security when implementing post-quantum cryptographic algorithms, as we can be assured that it will take significant technological advancement before these algorithms must be implemented. However, in addition to quantum computers gaining qubits at an ever larger rate, another thread is accelerating the onset of the quantum apocalypse: Regev's Algorithm [@regevEfficientQuantumFactoring2023]. 

If we imagine quantum apocalypse as a finish line that we run towards with ever increasing amounts of qubits, we can imagine Regev's algorithm as cutting the race in size by a significant magnitude. To summarize, Regev's algorithm utilizes Shor's approach to the order finding problem but generalizes to higher dimensions to compute this order faster. IN the end, this optimizes the discrete logarithm and prime factorization problems from running in $O(n^2)$ time complexity to running in $O(n^{\frac{3}{2}})$ time complexity. While remaining theoretical, Regev's algorithm moves the expiration date for modern cryptography ever so closer and further jeopardizes the Store-Now Decrypt-Later problem.
