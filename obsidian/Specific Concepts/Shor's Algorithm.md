Recall from the previous section that quantum computers pose an existential threat to current cryptographic standards, compromising both the RSA and ECC cryptosystems. This threat is due to an algorithm devised by Mathematician Peter Shor in 1994; ironically, it remains the only concrete feasible implementation of a quantum algorithm for a useful problem. 

Named Shor's Algorithm after its creator, the program solves the aforementioned prime factorization and discrete logarithm problems without the need for a key, thus bypassing all security guaranteed by the two protocols. Shor's Algorithm solves both problems by solving a related problem, the order finding problem, defined as follows for a given positive integer $a \in \mathbb{Z}^+$, and larger integer $N$: 
$$ \text{ord}_a = \text{ the smallest } r \text { where } a^r \equiv 1 \mod{N}$$
Utilizing some clever mathematics, one can convert both the discrete logarithm and prime factorization problem to the order finding problem. Shor's Algorithm, then, by finding a solution to the order finding solution, by proxy, has found a solution to the other two problems. In fact, Shor's Algorithm disqualifies a whole host of cryptographic schemes; RSA and ECC are simply the most important [@banegasConcreteQuantumCryptanalysis2020]. 

With two of the state-of-the-art in cryptographic systems rendered vulnerable to quantum-based attacks, it becomes vital that secure post-quantum cryptography (PQC) is developed, immune to Shor's Algorithm. It has, in essence, put an expiration date on our current algorithms [@roettelerQuantumResourceEstimates2017].
